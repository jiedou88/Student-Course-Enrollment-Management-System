Student Course Enrollment Management System

•	Designed and implement CourseManager class with dynamically allocated memory to manage all course classes and offer UI to interact with users so that users can access data via stream objects.

•	Designed Streamable class. This interface (a class with “only” pure virtual functions: store, load, display, read) enforces that the classes inherited from it are to be “streamable”.  IO streams allow program data to be exchanged with peripherals such as computer consoles or keyboards. 

•	Designed a base class, Course, which encapsulated information (e.g. course title, code, credit, etc.) about courses.

•	Designed two derived classes. A GenEdCourse class encapsulates information (e.g. language level) about general education courses (e.g. College English). An ICTCourse class encapsulates information (e.g. computer system) about computer-related courses (e.g. Object Oriented Programming).
